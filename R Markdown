# Premier League Title Prediction

Mikel Artetaâ€™s Arsenal is holding a five point advantage over Manchester City, and find themselves in first place in the Premier League at mid season. **14** of the last **18** teams to be in first place on Christmas day have ended the season as Premier League champions with a success rate of 78%, including Manchester City last year. But Manchester City is the only team who toppled the side top at Christmas in last two instances (Liverpool in 2018-19 and 2020-21).

* In the last six games Manchester city and Arsenal are the teams in the best form, 
taking **16** and **15** points respectively from possible **18 points**.

## Conclusion

It will be a neck and neck title race between the two teams at the top of the table, a slip up from one side could see them finishing in the second position and the other lifting the Premier League trophy.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "left",fig.cap = "Title race Predictions"}
final <-load("/cloud/project/final")

 gg<-final %>%
   ggplot(aes(x=Match.day,y=Points,color=Team,linetype=Match))+ geom_line()
 
 gg+scale_colour_manual(values = c(  "red","grey","grey","grey",
                                     "grey","grey","grey","grey","grey","grey",
                                       
                                      "grey","grey","dodgerblue2","grey","grey",
                                      "grey","grey","grey","grey","grey"))

# Who Will Qualify for the Champions League?

## First and Second position

For **Arsenal**, a first Premier League title since 2003-04 is certainly a possibility and they are currently the team with the highest chance of qualifying (**96%**) for the Champions League. Only surpassed by **Manchester City** (**99%**).

## Third poistion

**Liverpool** has the next highest chance of securing Champions League qualification and finishing in **third** position (**76.2%**) when looking at their form in last in the last 6 league games, 

* Taking away **13** points out of possible **18**. The *Third most* in form team only behind the two table toppers and the best and the best defense in the same time period, conceding only **once** in last **6** games. 

* However they are have been *less consistent* when playing **Away** this season, only having **12** points from a possible **39** points in *13 Away* games. This is a worrying trend.  

## Forth position

The battle for the **fourth** and final Champions League spot is will be the *most fierce*, with *Newcastle, Tottenham* and *Manchester United* separated by mere difference in points.

* **Tottenham** currently holds the Forth position, closely followed by Liverpool and Newcastle United.

* **Manchester United** was resurrected after the World cup and currently stands at third position but their form has been in steady decline, taking only **11** points from the last 6 matches (conceding **10** goals).

* Despite currently sitting in *sixth* place, **Newcastle United** also have a chance of securing Champions League qualification. They have the *strongest defense* in the league conceding only **18** goals in **25** matches as well as has **two extra games** than their competitors. 
  
* Speaking of **Chelsea**, the model predicts them to finish in the **10** th position.

 gg+scale_colour_manual(values = c( "white","white","white","white",
                                    "white","blue2","white","white","white",
                                    "white","white", "red4", "white","red3",
                                    "grey55","white","white","grey15",
                                    "white","white"))                         
```

# Relegation battle 

After Match day 26 the battle for safety from relegation to the second tier is getting more ferocious, only 3 points separating the last 6 places.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "left",out.width='25%'}
position <- c(15:20)                                
Team<- c( "Leicester City", "West Ham Utd","Leeds Utd","Everton","Southampton",
          "Bournemouth")
Points<-c(24,23,22,22,21,21)
tb<-data.frame(position,Team,Points)
View(tb)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "left",fig.cap="Relegation battle"}

 gg+scale_colour_manual(values = c( "white","white","darkred","white","white",
                                           "white","white","navy","white",
                                         "gold2","white","white", "white","white",
                                         "white","firebrick3","brown4","white",
                                         "white","white"))
                                         
```

* *Everton, Southampton* and *Bournemouth* are the teams on bottom of the table, and thier current form of taking **6**,**6**and **5** points respectively from a possibe *18* also suggest these team relegated to the second tier when the season is over.

* Also *Leeds Utd, Crystal Palace* and *Nottm Forest* are the teams with the worst form in the past 6 league games, taking **3**,**3** and **2** points respectively. 

## Conclusion

With only **4** point difference between the *bottom 3* positions of the table (18,19 and 20) and the **4** teams *above the drop zone* on top we can see a (14,15,16 and 17), the battle for safety from being demoted will be tight.
